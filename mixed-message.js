// Adding functionality

// get a random index for the quote
const quoteIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length);

// get a random index for authors
const authorIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * authors.length);

// get a random index for movieEpisode
const movieIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * movieEpisode.length);

// log to the console all together
console.log(
